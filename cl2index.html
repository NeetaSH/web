       <I> <u>The introduction to <b>object-oriented</b> concepts in <del>the lesson titled Object-oriented Programming Concepts</del> used a bicycle class as an example, with racing bikes, mountain bikes, and tandem bikes as subclasses. Here is sample code for a</u> possible implementation of a Bicycle class, to give you an overview of a class declaration. Subsequent sections of this lesson will back up and explain class declarations step by step. For the moment, don't concern yourself with the details.</i>

    <p>This is a <b>class declaration</b>. The class body (the area between the braces) <del>contains all the code that provides</del> for the life cycle of the objects created from the class: constructors for initializing new objects, declarations for the fields that provide the state of the class and its objects, and methods to implement the behavior of the class and its objects.</p>
